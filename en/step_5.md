## Champion self-nomination form

Talking to your volunteers in advance about succession and giving people the opportunity to put themselves forward as a potential successor can save the champion time and potential embarrassment if they select a successor themselves, who actually has no interest in developing their role in the Dojo.

  The self-nomination form can ask about the knowledge, skills and abilities that are useful for people in a champion position. It can help the person putting themselves forward to get a better idea of the expectations of them in the position.

Example questions for a self-nomination form:
- What has attracted you to nominate yourself to be a co-champion of this Dojo?
- How much time each week would you be available to support the management of the Dojo?
- What areas in terms of the management of the club are you most confident in your ability to complete, and least confident in?
- What do you see as the three most important things for managing a Dojo?
