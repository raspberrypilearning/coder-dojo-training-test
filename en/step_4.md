### 5 steps of succession
- Identifying key roles, tasks and responsibilities
- Identifying and preparing volunteers
- Developing and training volunteers
- Monitoring development and recognizing progress
- Informing the Foundation, succession and follow up

## Succession plan types
The type of plan your Dojo chooses depends on what stage in the process you are in relation to champion succession. At the very least the steps in the emergency succession plan should be covered.

- Team development (rainy-day succession)
- Future planned succession
- Emergency succession

In advance of choosing which succession plan suits your needs it is worth looking at what is already working well in your Dojo in terms of mentor development, and what isnâ€™t. You can build on what is working well using this toolkit.
